    Summary: 
        Predicts the phishing status (This function is temporarily used until the ML model is implemented)

    Description: 
        The phishing features array is converted to a numpy array.\n
        The mean value of the array is calculated.\n
        The phishing status is initialized to 0.\n
        If the mean value is closer to -1 than 1, the phishing status is set to -1.\n
        If the mean value is closer to 1 than -1, the phishing status is set to 1.\n
        The phishing status is returned.\n

    Arguments: 
        phishing_features_array (list): The phishing features array.

    Returns: 
        phishing_status (int): The phishing status.

    Exceptions: 
        In case of an exception during the execution of the function, an error message is printed to the console and 0 is returned.
